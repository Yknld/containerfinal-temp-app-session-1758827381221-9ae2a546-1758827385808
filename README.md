# Expo App

This is a React Native Expo app generated by ContainerFinal.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```
   npx expo start
   ```

## Requirements

- Fix these errors in the Expo app:

tsconfig.json(3,3): error TS5098: Option 'customConditions' can only be used when 'moduleResolution' is set to 'node16', 'nodenext', or 'bundler'.

Make minimal targeted fixes to resolve the errors above.

CRITICAL REANIMATED RESTRICTION:
- DO NOT use react-native-reanimated in any form
- If react-native-reanimated is present in package.json, REMOVE it completely
- If any imports use react-native-reanimated, replace with standard React Native animations
- Use Animated from 'react-native' instead of Reanimated
- Remove any worklet functions, useSharedValue, useAnimatedStyle, etc.
- Replace Reanimated animations with standard Animated.timing, Animated.spring, etc.

IMPORTANT: 
- FIRST: Check if the existing app already meets all the user requirements. If it does, DO NOT make any changes - simply call the finish action immediately
- DO NOT run development servers or ask for user input
- DO NOT wait for confirmation - complete the task and finish immediately
- When you're done creating/modifying files, IMMEDIATELY use the finish action to end the task
- DO NOT provide summaries or explanations after completing the work
- Only fix the specific errors shown above

CRITICAL: After completing your work, call the finish action immediately. Do not wait or provide additional commentary.
